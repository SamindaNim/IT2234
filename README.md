JavaScript Array Manipulation   
This project demonstrates various methods to manipulate and display arrays in JavaScript. It includes examples for:
- Displaying 1D arrays using different methods
- Finding the maximum number in an array
- Working with 2D arrays
- Displaying string and character arrays

Features
- Array Display:Multiple methods to print array elements.
- Finding Maximum Value:Using the `forEach` loop.
- 2D Array Handling:Iterating through nested arrays.
- String and Character Arrays:Displaying different types of data in arrays.

Code Explanation
1. Displaying 1D Arrays
- Using `console.log()` directly.
- Using a `for` loop.
- Using the `forEach` method.

2. Finding Maximum Number
- Iterates through an array using `forEach`.
- Compares each element to track the highest value.

3. 2D Array Display
- Uses nested loops (`for` loop and `forEach`) to print elements row-wise.

4. String and Character Arrays
- Demonstrates handling different data types in arrays.

File name:- CommonElement.js   
Find Common Elements in Two Arrays

This JavaScript program finds the common elements between two arrays using different methods.  
The methods include:
- Nested For Loop  
  Uses two loops to compare each element in array A with each element in array B.
  
- ForEach Loop  
  Iterates through each element in A and B.

File name:- JsonConcept.js   
JSON and JavaScript Objects  
This project demonstrates the use of JSON-like objects in JavaScript. It covers creating single objects, arrays of objects, and accessing object properties.

1. Creating a Single Object
This creates an object student with properties like regno, name, age, and course.
We access name using student.name

2. Creating an Array of Objects
This creates an array students containing multiple student objects.

Printing students outputs the entire array.

File name:- MostFrequentElement.js   
Most Frequent Element in an Array    
This JavaScript program finds the most frequently occurring element in an array.

File name:- PopPush.js   
Array Operations - Pop & Push
This is a simple example demonstrating the usage of two common array operations in JavaScript: `push()` and `pop()`.  

Operations
- push(): Adds an element to the end of an array.
- pop(): Removes the last element from an array.

File name:- ReversePushPop.js   
Array Reversal Using Push and Pop  
This project demonstrates how to reverse an array in JavaScript using the `push()` and `pop()` methods.  

The code takes an initial array and reverses its order by:  

1. Popping elements from the original array.
2. Pushing them into a new array.
3. Displaying the reversed array.

File name:- SumTarget.js   
Find All Pairs That Sum Up to Target   
This JavaScript script finds all pairs of elements in an array that sum up to a given target value.
